# HTML/CSS Practice Project - Odin

# Update 23/03/2025 - CSS Version Phase 1

Starting 23rd of March, updating the recipes page with CSS Practice until end of the foundations course conserning CSS, learning goals for CSS and post project reflection at the end of the course before moving onto JavaScript.

# HTML Phase

Idea of this practice project is to get a refresher on HTML basics and build a single webpage
containing a few recipes.

By the end of the project, I will handle the following skills:

  - Utilise HTML boilerplate.

  - Use elements and tags properly.

  - Work with text of the document utilising emphasis when necessary.

  - Know how to use lists for their intended purpose.

  - Create links from the main index file to other recipes relative to main directory.

  - Utilise media sources such as images for recipes and using appropriate screen reader friendly alternatives for images.

  - Practice good commiting conventions to GitHub provided by Odin Project tutoring.

# Update 22/03/2025 - HTML Basics version complete (expect iterations with further skills in the future)

In conclusion I learned the following.

  - Use emmet abbreviations for HTML boilerplate and fill in the necessary fields of such as the title.

  - Use one h1 header per page, and utilised other headers and paragraphs where necessary.

  - Utilised unordered and ordered lists for their purpose such as listing the ingredients needed for the recipe and steps to produce it. 
  Also utilised emmet abbreviations to make multiple list elements quickly.

  - Separated main index.html and each recipe to their own folders and linked the pages relatively to get access two-ways from main index to the recipes.

  - Used stock images to get some flair for the recipes and removed their zone.identifier file to declutter the images folder and linked them properly to each recipe page, gave them alternative attributes for screen-readers and re-sized them to better fit the page.

  - Used iterative tactics and good commit habits to document the process of building the webpage.

  - Reinforced the basics of HTML, and understood the idea that I can further iterate on this project after getting a refresher on CSS and JavaScript, so expect updates to this.
