# HTML Practice Project - Odin

Idea of this practice project is to get a refresher on HTML basics and build a single webpage
containing a few recipes.

By the end of the project, I will handle the following skills:

  - Utilise HTML boilerplate.

  - Use elements and tags properly.

  - Work with text of the document utilising emphasis when necessary.

  - Know how to use lists for their intended purpose.

  - Create links from the main index file to other recipes relative to main directory.

  - Utilise media sources such as images for recipes and using appropriate screen reader friendly alternatives for images.

  - Practice good commiting conventions to GitHub provided by Odin Project tutoring.
